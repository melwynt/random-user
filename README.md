# Getting Started with `random-user` repo

This project is an updated version of this tutorial:
[# Fetch Data from an API in React.js - Part 12](https://youtu.be/T3Px88x_PsA) by Ben Awad.

This tutorial shows how to use this API:

- [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)

The original tutorial uses React Class Components.

This current repo is a remastered version with React Hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`).

## How to run it?
